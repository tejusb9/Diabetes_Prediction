 What is Diabetes? Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas is no longer able to make insulin, or when the body cannot make good use of the insulin it produces. Learning how to use Machine Learning can help us predict Diabetes. Letâ€™s get started!  About this project :- The objective of this project is to classify whether someone has diabetes or not.
